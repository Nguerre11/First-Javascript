##Workflow ☑️
1 Planning system ☑️
    Assign syllabus to Excel spreadsheet
    Estimate hours per syllabus including margin of error (reviews - practice)
2.Pre-learning system (1 layer encoding) [1H]
    Select Index Global ☑️
    Separate them by global themes (Git - GitHub)☑️
    Create an accurate index of the themes (class-until-class number)
3.Atopic learning [2H] 
    Review Videos El ☑️ (don't need this step for this course)
    Analysis → creation of high-level learning hypotheses ☑️☑️
        Review Open AI ☑️ ☑️☑️
        Why is it important? ☑️ ☑️☑️
        Can I relate them?  ☑️☑️☑️
        Can I simplify them? ☑️☑️☑️
        Can I categorize them into fragments? ☑️☑️☑️
        I've finished Big Picture? ☑️(I've just create relations on this folder, don't draw organization system)

Learning Workflow (2 layer encoding) [+20H] if Class==conceptual-comprehension, else omit it
    1.Trends Index ☑️(not necesary)
        Video 2.0X
        a.Identify where is "conceptual comprehension" 
        b. Apply high order learning encoding (do not
        memorize or understand, relate, compare and
        organize)
        b. Identify the key points
        c. I stop it when I've got "conceptual comprehension"
        Code within the organization system (Big Picture) (layer 1)
    2.Atopic learning (Quick review of multiple sources) if Class==code-comprehension
        Review Forum
        Select Summary
        Understand it
        Use Open AI to reinforce
        Reinforce Big Picture (layer 2)
    3.Comprehension Workflow and practical application
        Divide Big Picture - Workflow by theme
        Video 1.0X"
        Focus on comprehension  "code comprehension"
        Relate and create a 1-layer coding workflow
        Program at the end of class. !important
    4.Design Workflow coding 2 layer + Accumulative project (optional)
        Step-by-step system of a definitive goal
        Design Workflow .js files and readme
        Create documentation based on this.
    5. Feedback Loop What did u useful?
        Tranlate throught Open AI
        English Open AI
        Relate things to pre-learning progress
        View once video 1.0X
        test code throughtout of class
        practique-end
        Organizacion system by colors
        //////////What aren´t u sure 
        view twice the videos 
        view-end the comments 

        
    !important -> Im actually using the inspector to practique Javascript-code
