##Workflow ☑️
1 Planning system ☑️
    Assign syllabus to Excel spreadsheet
    Estimate hours per syllabus including margin of error (reviews - practice)
2.Pre-learning system (1 layer encoding) [1H]
    Select Index Global ☑️
    Separate them by global themes (Git - GitHub)☑️
    Create an accurate index of the themes (class-until-class number)
3.Atopic learning [2H] 
    Review Videos El ☑️ (don't need this step for this course)
    Analysis → creation of high-level learning hypotheses ☑️☑️
        Review Open AI ☑️ ☑️☑️
        Why is it important? ☑️ ☑️☑️
        Can I relate them?  ☑️☑️☑️
        Can I simplify them? ☑️☑️☑️
        Can I categorize them into fragments? ☑️☑️☑️
        I've finished Big Picture? ☑️(I've just create relations on this folder, don't draw organization system)

Learning Workflow (2 layer encoding) [+20H]
    1.Trends Index ☑️(not necesary)
        Video 2.0X
        a.Identify where is "conceptual comprehension" 
        b. Apply high order learning encoding (do not
        memorize or understand, relate, compare and
        organize)
        b. Identify the key points
        c. I stop it when I've got "conceptual comprehension"
        Code within the organization system (Big Picture) (layer 1)
    2.Atopic learning (Quick review of multiple sources)
        Review Forum
        Select Summary
        Understand it
        Use Open AI to reinforce
        Reinforce Big Picture (layer 2)
    3.Comprehension Workflow and practical application
        Divide Big Picture - Workflow by theme
        Video 1.0X"
        Focus on comprehension  "code comprehension"
        Relate and create a 1-layer coding workflow
        Program at the end of class. !important
    4.Design Workflow coding 2 layer + Accumulative project (optional)
        Step-by-step system of a definitive goal
        Design Workflow .js files and readme
        Create documentation based on this.
